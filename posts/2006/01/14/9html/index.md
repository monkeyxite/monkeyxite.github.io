When a discussion started about learning vim on the vim list Juergen Salk mentioned the "*" key as something that he wished he had know earlier. When I read the mail I had to go help on what the heck the "*" did. I also wish I had known earlier...
“菊花”键是很有用的，老外说话好费劲啊～中国四个字足以：相见恨晚
Using the "*" key while in normal mode searches for the word under the cursor.
“菊花”是查找光标下相同单词用的～
If that doesn't save you a lot of typing, I don't know what will.
如果这样都不能减少你的录入的话，我真不知道什么会了～哈哈，似乎用虚拟语态的话更有感情一些哦
