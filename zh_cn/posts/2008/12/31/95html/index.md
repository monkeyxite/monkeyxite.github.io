</p>Though, for me  "Change" is exactly the topic of 2008.
<ul><li>I spent almost the coldest two winners of my life this year(both in Chengdu during the whole Jan.  and in Dec. when I am here, in Beijing ).
</li><li>We were survived in the Earthquake, facing lots of situations which reflect who you are. This changed my view of life.</li><li>I was finally graduated from school. However,   a little bit difference from what I expected. This is the change of my role in this world.
</li><li>There are  so many changes in this year that i can not even list all of them in this post. Change different departments, career, time management, development platform......</li><li>Wish in the next year, there will only be surprises, no unexpected changes, anymore.</li></ul>Farewell, 2008</body></html>
